# Sagehen-Sprint

I am currently teaching myself CSS/ HTML5/ Javascript. After finishing my first course in CS in the Spring '21 semester, I realized that I wanted to implement my drawings with some computer code! My goal is to create a simple game using my design of Pomona College's mascot, Cecil the Sagehen.
