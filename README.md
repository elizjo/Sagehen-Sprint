# Sagehen-Sprint

I am currently teaching myself CSS/ HTML5/ Javascript. After finishing my first course in CS in the Spring '21 semester, I realized that I wanted to implement my drawings with some computer code! My goal is to create a simple game using my design of Pomona College's mascot, Cecil the Sagehen.

# Evolution of Project
Since my first language is Python, I tried to use the Pygame extension to create the game. I hoped to learn more object-oriented programming with Python through using Pygame. However, I realized that I would like this game to be more accessable to Pomona Students and Sagehen Fans and switched the implementation of the project to HTML/ CSS/ and Javascript. I had done some (*very*) simple websites with HTML/ CSS/ and Javascript, but this project has allowed me to explore the extensive styling elements of CSS and more about Javascript's syntax. 

# Version 1 (Sept 11-18th 2021)
![](version1-sept16-2021.gif)

- used CSS to style Cecil the Sagehen
- used animate feature on CSS to coordinate Cecil's walk & scrolling background
- added multiple classes for Cecil, the fire obstacle, and background from the CSS file to the HTML 
- goal for next version- add color to Cecil, jump feature, more versions/variation of fire obstacles & background
  - also, improve the playback of the game animation on github
  - gifs are hard! this gif is much slower than the current animation on the style.css file

# Version 2 (Sept 18-25th 2021)
